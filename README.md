This project implements a real-time object detection and tracking system using NVIDIA DeepStream SDK in C++. It detects and tracks multiple object classes across camera streams, ensuring that each object retains a unique ID throughout its presence in the scene. Detection data, including timestamps, object IDs, classes, and bounding box coordinates, is logged to a structured text file. A custom event-based mechanism monitors proximity between forklifts and trucksâ€”when a forklift comes within 300 pixels of a truck, the system captures the frame and saves the image with a timestamped filename. To ensure privacy, a custom GStreamer plugin was developed and integrated into the DeepStream pipeline to blur detected humans before saving the image. The entire solution is optimized for real-time performance with efficient memory management and low-latency processing, making it ideal for industrial surveillance and intelligent monitoring applications.
